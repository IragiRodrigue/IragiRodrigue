# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate developer with expertise in Django, React Native, Tkinter (with ttkbootstrap), and MySQL. I enjoy building robust applications, working with databases, and enhancing UI/UX with modern design principles.

## âœ¨ About Me

Innovation has always been a driving force in my life. We live in a world where it often seems like we have answers to everything, and while many may be content with that, I am not. For as long as I can remember, I have sought to take "the next step" or be responsible for "the next big thing." My passion for computers equips me with the tools to achieve that goal. In the future, I do not want to be remembered as someone who was inspired by othersâ€”I want to be the one who inspires. For this reason, I have never aspired to become the next Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, or Bill Gates; instead, I strive to become the first Iragi Rodrigue.
